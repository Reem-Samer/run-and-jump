# run-and-jump
![Screenshot](college.png)


 In this project, we built a jump and run browser game that built into Google Chrome web browser. Our players had to avoid the F failure by jumping above it to achieve the higher score, all players can challenge each other and win by achieving the highest score.

# Look & Feel:
In our game we wanted to do a related design to our life in college, so we set the character to be a student that wants to avoid obstacles which in this case is failing classes -getting an F in a class.

We wanted to add more fun and interactive things so the user can enjoy playing the game so we add hover and click functions so that if the user hovers or clicks over some objects it can change background color, shadow, and or font color.

# Dynamic Components:
We used javascript to interact with the game, the class was called script2.js.
